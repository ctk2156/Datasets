RGB-D and Ambient Occlusion Datasets  

[IRS Dataset](https://github.com/blackjack2015/IRS), a synthetic dataset for disparity estimation. We did a little bit of work with origin dataset including converting the disparity image to depth image and remove samples with incomplete depth image. Result containing 40k+ indoor scene RGB image with matching normal image and depth image(unit in millimeter), resolution is 960*540.
